# Importing Data From Excel

## Copy & Pasting

You can copy paste columns of data into R from excel! This can save time if you don't want to worry about working directory or file paths.

### Step 1

Select rows of data in excel and ctrl+c them.

### Step 2

Assign a variable for where you want to paste the data, using the scan() function.

```
x <- scan()
```

### Step 3

Ctrl+v to paste your data into R's console (the input area where you type commands).

Hit enter to "end" the scan() function.


### ALTERNATIVELY

If you would like to copy a full dataset, first copy from excel then try:

```r

dat <- read.csv("clipboard", sep="\t")

# if you included names in the first row:
names(dat) <- dat[1,]
dat <- dat[-1,]

```
If you want to store this data in your script for future use (this is only recommended for small datasets, otherwise store as a separate csv file):

```r
dump( "dat", file = "clipboard" )
```

You can then paste the output into your R script and it will be easy to load next time you open the file. The output looks like this, but it will read in as a normal data frame.

```r
dat <-
structure(list(year = c(1958L, 1975L, 1985L, 1995L, 2005L, 2015L
), measurement = c(NA, 1367L, 8253L, 9685L, 17582L, 25728L), 
    determinants = c(NA, NA, 336L, 1534L, 11975L, 18665L), outcomes = c(1517L, 
    2160L, 7920L, 26580L, 45446L, 69378L), intervention = c(NA, 
    NA, NA, NA, 5922L, 7209L), policy = c(NA, NA, NA, 14287L, 
    18584L, 25716L)), .Names = c("year", "measurement", "determinants", 
"outcomes", "intervention", "policy"), class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, 
-6L))
```

## NOTES ABOUT SCAN()

* Scan only works for numbers! 

Copy pasting this:

![example](http://i.imgur.com/X9dgRk8.png)

Will return this: 

```
Error in scan(file, what, nmax, sep, dec, quote, skip, nlines, na.strings,  : scan() expected 'a real', got 'test'
```

## Importing from .xlsx

This is for when you have an excel file (.xlsx) which is too big to copy paste or you're too lazy to save it as a .csv or other file type.

## Step 1 

Make sure your working directory is set!

```
getwd()
setwd("./Data")
```

## Step 2 

Install and call the package xlsx which you can use to import excel files.

```
install.packages("xlsx")
library(xlsx)
```


## Step 3

Read in your excel file using this one easy command.

```
dat <- read.xlsx(""./Data/RoryData.xlsx", sheetName="Sheet1")
```


## Notes About Read  .xlsx #

Make sure you include your sheet name or it won't work. By default in excel, the first sheet is "Sheet1" as used in the example above.
